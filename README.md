**Kata builds the best AI agent for a subnet through open competition — so anyone can
mine that subnet with a proven, optimized agent.**

Mining a subnet well usually takes deep, subnet-specific expertise. Kata crowdsources
it: contributors compete to build the strongest agent for a subnet, and Kata keeps the
current best one — the **king** — continuously battle-tested and ready to run.

It works as a continuous **"king of the hill"** tournament. A contributor opens a pull
request that adds **one** agent; Kata evaluates it head-to-head against the reigning
king on a fixed benchmark, inside an isolated sandbox. If the challenger objectively
wins, its PR is merged and it becomes the new king. The king is always the current best
subnet-specific agent — agent quality becomes a merge decision, not a review opinion.

Today Kata runs **one subnet: SN60** (`sn60__bitsec`), a security lane where agents
find critical- and high-severity vulnerabilities in smart-contract code. The long-term
goal is **one-click mining** — pick any supported subnet and mine it with Kata's
optimized king agent, no ML expertise required.

## Why Kata

- **Objective, not subjective.** A challenger wins only by beating the current king on
  a fixed, versioned benchmark — never by PR size or reviewer opinion.
- **Reproducible.** Every duel records its provenance (benchmark hash, artifact
  hashes, engine version) so results stay comparable over time.
- **Fair by design.** Contributors submit only an agent. The engine runs every agent
  on the *same* pinned model in an isolated sandbox, so agents compete on skill — not
  on private API access or a bigger budget.
- **One engine, many subnets.** Adding a new subnet is a pack + registry change, not
  an engine rewrite — the same loop produces an optimized king for each.

## Architecture

Kata is a small set of focused components:

| Component | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **kata** | The engine (this repo): pack registry, lane state, screening, evaluation, the king-vs-candidate duel, and promotion. |
| **kata-bot** | GitHub automation: webhook intake, a durable PR queue, and the resident service that runs the engine end-to-end and applies PR labels. |
| **kata-board** | Dashboard that reads lane state and live evaluation status. |
| **sandbox** | Pinned benchmark harness (agent runner + scorer) for the active pack. Isolated and version-locked; never edited by Kata. |

**Pack model.** A central registry (`lanes/registry.json`) lists the active packs.
Each pack keeps isolated state under `lanes/<lane-id>/` and one current king under
`kings/<pack>/<mode>/`. The engine, bot, and board discover packs only through the
registry.

**Isolated, fair execution.** Agents run inside an internet-blocked sandbox and reach
a model only through an endpoint the engine controls. The engine pins every agent to
one fixed model, so the king and every challenger are evaluated on identical footing.

```

## The competition loop

The full workflow from a pull request to a new king:

1. **Submit.** A contributor opens a PR that adds exactly one agent bundle under
   `submissions/<pack>/<mode>/<submission-id>/`.
2. **Validate.** `kata-bot` checks the PR shape (one bundle, correct files, no edits
   outside the submission) and enqueues a durable job.
3. **Screen.** The engine runs static checks plus a single sandbox execution to reject
   broken or non-conforming agents cheaply, before any expensive evaluation.
4. **Duel.** The candidate and the current king each run repeated replicas across the
   benchmark codebases in the pinned sandbox.
5. **Decide.** The winner is chosen by a strict comparator — **aggregated score**,
   then **codebases passed**, then **true positives**. A candidate with any invalid
   run cannot win. The PR resolves to one action: `merge`, `close-losing`,
   `close-invalid`, or `rerun-stale`.
6. **Verify freshness.** Before a merge, the result is re-checked against the current
   king and the pinned benchmark snapshot; a stale result is re-run rather than merged.
7. **Promote.** A verified winner is merged, labeled, published as the new king under
   `kings/`, and recorded in the lane state. `submissions/` is cleared so it stays
   empty between active PRs, while `kings/` remains the public source of truth.

## How to submit an agent

You only ever edit `submissions/`. A submission is a small bundle:

```text
submissions/<pack>/<mode>/<submission-id>/
  agent.py            # your entrypoint: def agent_main(...) -> {"vulnerabilities": [...]}
  agent_manifest.json # bundle contract (schema_version, runtime, entrypoint)
  submission.json     # which pack/mode you're competing in
```

```bash
# 1. scaffold a submission
uv run kata submission init \
  --subnet-pack sn60__bitsec --mode miner --submission-id you-20260703-01

# 2. edit submissions/sn60__bitsec/miner/you-20260703-01/agent.py

# 3. validate it locally before opening a PR
uv run kata submission validate \
  --path submissions/sn60__bitsec/miner/you-20260703-01

# 4. commit on a branch, push, and open a PR against the default branch
```

The full submission contract, required files, and anti-cheat rules are in
**[docs/submissions.md](docs/submissions.md)**.

## Contributing to the engine

Improvements to the evaluator, pack workflow, or competition machinery are welcome.
Local checks:

```bash
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest
uv run --extra dev python -m ruff check kata tests
```

## Gittensor integration

Kata is registered on Gittensor, and `kata-bot` records the outcome of every duel as an
**objective label** on the pull request so the result can be read without re-running the
evaluation. This is implemented today for the live `sn60__bitsec` pack:

- `kata:winner:sn60__bitsec` — a verified king promotion. Applied only after the duel
  and freshness checks pass.
- `kata:mode:miner` — the competition mode.
- `kata:invalid`, `kata:losing`, `kata:stale`, `kata:hold` — non-winning outcomes.

Gittensor's **label and score rules** read these labels, so only a verified
`kata:winner:*` promotion is recognized as a valid result — not PR size or opinion. As
more subnets go live, each gets its own `kata:winner:<pack>` label, so packs can be
scored independently.

---

## Roadmap

Kata's goal is **one-click mining** — letting anyone mine a supported subnet with its
optimized king agent, no ML expertise required. See
**[docs/milestones.md](docs/milestones.md)** for the current status and the releases
toward it.

## Repository layout

- `kata/` — engine: pack registry, lane state, screening, evaluator, promotion.
- `lanes/` — central pack registry (`registry.json`) plus per-lane state.
- `kings/` — the published current king artifact per pack and mode.
- `submissions/` — PR-submitted candidate bundles (empty between active PRs).
- `runs/` — duel artifacts with reproducible provenance.
